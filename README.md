# Food-Classification-CNN
A computer vision project on classification of food category though an image
## DOMAIN: Food Industry
## PROJECT OBJECTIVE: 
Design a Deep Learning based Food identification model
## CONTEXT: 
Computer  vision  can  be  used  to  automate  supervision  and  generate appropriate  action  trigger  if  the  event  is predicted from the image of interest. For example food items can be easily identified by a camera as make of the type of the food, colour of the food, ingredients etc.
## DATA DESCRIPTION:
- The  'Food101  dataset' is a popular food image dataset available on Kaggle. It contains  101  classes  of  foods, each having 1000 images. Classes are typically the names of the food, e.g. apple_pie, french fries, samosa etc.
- In our use case we have used only a subset of this large dataset to train our models. We used only 6 categories of food due to limited computing resources.

- Reference: It was used in the Paper "Food-101 â€“ Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests" by Lukas Bossard, Matthieu Guillaumin and Luc Van Gool. It's a good (large dataset) for testing computer vision techniques
## Steps taken in the Project:
1. Data Preparation:
- Importing the dataset
-  Mapping training and testing images to their classes
- Preprocessing and Visualisation of different classes 
2. Model Building and training:
- Design, train and test different CNN models for classification, using Transfer Learning
- Built models like Vgg16, InceptionV3, EffNetB0, MobileNetV1 that were pre-trained on the 'ImageNet' dataset
- Optimized these models by adding custom layers and using hyperparameter tuning
## Conclusions:
MobileNetV1 stood out as the best performing model with 0.81 f1-score
